This is the Water Me! app from the Android learning courses.

The Water Me! app consists of a list of plants, some information about them, and a description for how often each one should be watered. For each of these plants, the completed app will schedule a reminder for when they should be watered.

This is the completed version, as Android provides some of the basics, and we fill in the rest of the code.
